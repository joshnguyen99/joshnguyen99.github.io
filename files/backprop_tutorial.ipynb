    "In this post, we will go through an exercise involving backpropagation for a fully connected feed-forward neural network. Though simple, I observe that a lot of \"Introduction to Machine Learning\" courses don't tend to explain this example thoroughly enough. In fact, a common way students are taught about optimizing a neural network is that the gradients can be calculated using an algorithm called *backpropagation* (a.k.a. the chain rule), and the parameters are updated using gradient descent. However, the chain rule, apart from its formula, is typically swept under the rug and replaced by a \"black box\" operation called *autograd*.\n",

    "I think being able to implement backpropagation, at least in the simplest case, is quite important for its conceptual understanding. Hopefully this will benefit the students who stumble upon this page after a while of searching for \"How to implement backprop.\""
