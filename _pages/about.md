I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu), the University of Pennsylvania, where I work with [Duncan Watts](https://duncanjwatts.com/) at the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu).

I am broadly interested in developing computational and human-in-the-loop methods to study individual and collective human behavior. Examples of such behavior include moral decision-making and judgment, stance toward socially significant issues, and commonsense knowledge and reasoning. The tools to study them are grounded in machine learning, network science, natural language processing, social psychology and crowdsourcing.

Prior to joining Penn I was an M.Phil. student at the [Computational Media Lab](http://cm.cecs.anu.edu.au/), the Australian National University where I was jointly advised by [Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx) (School of Computing) and [Colin Klein](http://colinklein.org) (School of Philosophy). My thesis presents a series of large-scale studies of online discussions to uncover popular topics of contemporary moral concern, and characterize how moral dilemmas are framed and how they are perceived and judged by internet users. My research was also supported by the [Humanising Machine Intelligence](https://hmi.anu.edu.au) Grand Challenge at ANU.

Prior to that I pursued B.S. in computer science at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au), the University of Melbourne. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Charl Ras](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/199833-charl-ras) at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au) on designing resilient network embeddings.

I also have a special interest in mathematical optimization, especially in the context of machine learning. I have collaborated with [Nguyen Tran](https://nguyenhoangtran.github.io) at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), the University of Sydney, on designing personalized and communication-efficient algorithms for federated learning.

I publish under my official Vietnamese name, Tuan Dung Nguyen.
