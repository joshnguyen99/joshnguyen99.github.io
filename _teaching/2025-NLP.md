Overview
======
This course provides an introductory overview of the field of natural language processing. The goal of the field is to build technologies that will allow machines to understand human languages. Applications include machine translation, automatic summarization, question answering systems, and dialog systems.

The course material is based on two textbooks:
1. [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3), 3rd edition draft, by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin.
2. [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/tree/master/notes) by Jacob Eisenstein.
